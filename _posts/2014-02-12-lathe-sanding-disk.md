While making Christmas ornaments, I found myself needing to sand hundreds of
pieces of wood flat. I would love to have a dedicated disk sander, but with
space and budget constraints being what they are, I figured I would make a few
sanding disks for my lathe.

I'd seen [others](http://www.homemadetools.net/lathe-faceplate-sanding-disc)
do similar things, and so I cut out a few nearly-round pieces of MDF that I
glued to a couple of small pieces in which I'd already turned tenons. With
the disks all glued, I mounted each in turn in the chuck and trued the disk
up. I created a few because they're cheap and I figured it would save me all the
hassle of trying to swap out the paper regularly.

They served their original purpose quite well. Though I lost a few fingertips,
I was able to sand both sides of 200 ornaments through two grits in a total of
about 5 or so hours. For those curious, that's one side every 20 or 30 seconds.
