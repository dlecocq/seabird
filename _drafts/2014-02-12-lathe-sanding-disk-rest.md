Having already made a set of sanding disks for my lathe, I find myself using
them with relative frequency. They're great for cleaning up rough surfaces, but
in many cases I want to keep the side I'm sanding perpendicular to another side.
While this can be done free-hand, it is certainly prone to mistakes.
